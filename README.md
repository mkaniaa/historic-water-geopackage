This project is still in progress. You can see working online trial version on: http://openhydrology.org/maps/historic-water/

Historic Water is a map portal used to visualize spatial changes taking place in time. The application displays vector thematic layers, created by drawing hydrography of Krakow from historical maps from different years. An additional element is a layer showing the location of flood marks in the city and a time line that allows you to filter the displayed signs in relation to the dates of floods. The tool allows for quick analysis of changes in the state of a given event in time.

Technical informations:
technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, GeoJSON, PHP
framework: ReactJS + Redux
database: Geopackage (SQLite database container with support for spatial data)
vector layers: made in spatial desktop app QGIS 3.6
source for vector layers: https://dawnemapykrakowa.pl/

To run database server (server folder) you need Apache with SQLite support. Server functions returns vector objects in GeoJSON format in coordinate system OGC:1.3:CRS84 (4326).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
